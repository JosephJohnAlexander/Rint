# DSE Typewriter

<https://webonastick.com/fonts/dse-typewriter/>

A project to create a coding font inspired by early 20th-century
typewriters.

And to practice editing fonts directly in FontForge.

## About This Font

This font is not the result of any scans or traces of samples,
specimens, or other output from an actual typewriter.

It's more like an amalgamation of old-school typewriter fonts with
features semi-arbitrarily picked from each one, as well as a few not
in use on actual typewriters.

## Features and Characteristics

-   Relatively low ex-height.

-   Lining numerals, i.e., all start at the baseline and end at the
    same height.

-   Full ASCII and Latin-1 coverage, along with selected extended
    Latin, punctuation, graphic, and currency symbols.

-   Coding-friendly distinctive characters: `li1|` `Oo0` `` `'" ``

-   Elite scale typeface (12 characters per inch at 12-point font
    size).

-   Perfectly useful as a traditional typewriter face for other
    purposes, if you don&rsquo;t mind the zero (0) having a dot in the
    middle.

## Caveats and Answers to Questions You Might Ask

-   There aren't any hints, so on certain platforms, this font may not
    be readable at lower font sizes.  Auto-hints seem to work okay-ish
    in Windows Google Chrome.

    Chances are, at any particular point in time, my brain is too mush
    to learn how to do those.

-   This is most definitely a work in progress.
