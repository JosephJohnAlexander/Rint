# DSE Typewriter

<https://webonastick.com/fonts/dse-typewriter/>

A project to create a coding font inspired by pre-war typewriters.

And to practice editing fonts directly in FontForge.

## About This Font

This font is not the result of any scans or traces of samples,
specimens, or other output from an actual typewriter.

It's more like an amalgamation of old-school typewriter fonts with
features semi-arbitrarily picked from each one, as well as a few not
in use on actual typewriters.

## Characteristics

-   Low ex-height.

-   Lining numerals, i.e., all start at the baseline and end at the same height.

-   Full ASCII and Latin-1 coverage, and then some.

-   Coding-friendly distinctive characters: `li1|` `Oo0` `` `'" ``

-   It's elite!  As in, not pica.

## Unicode Coverage

-   All printable ASCII (U+0020 through U+007E) and ISO Latin-1 (U+00A0 through U+00FF),
    and selected extended Latin characters (more to come, I suppose).

-   Selected punctuation, graphic, and currency symbols.

## Answers to Questions You Might Ask

-   There aren't any hints.  Chances are, at any particular point in
    time, my brain is too mush to learn how to do those.
